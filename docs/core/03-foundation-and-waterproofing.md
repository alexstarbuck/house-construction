Ensuring a strong, stable, and waterproof base for the house.

  
1. **Foundation Construction**
    - Pour reinforced foundation slab (not strip footings, as per geotechnical recommendations);
    - Ensure steel reinforcement bars are correctly placed;
    - Use waterproof concrete additives to reduce permeability;
    - Conduct on-site inspection before pouring (structural engineer);
    
2. **Waterproofing & Insulation of Foundation and Lower Walls**
    - Apply cementitious waterproofing to foundation walls;
    - Install bituminous membrane or self-adhesive waterproof layer;
    - Place dimpled drainage membrane (Delta-MS or similar);
    - Use XPS insulation boards for thermal protection;
    - Ensure proper backfilling with gravel, not fine soil;

### Dependencies:
Cannot start structural work until waterproofing and insulation are completed.
