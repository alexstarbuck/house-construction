Ensuring the site is correctly prepared for foundation work.

  
1. **Demolition of Old Structure (if applicable)**
    - Disconnect utilities (water, electricity, gas);
    - Ensure proper disposal of demolition waste (obtain potvrda o zbrinjavanju otpada if required);
    - Verify site leveling to ensure correct zero point before excavation;
    
2. **Excavation & Groundworks**
    - Supervise excavation depth & soil conditions (geomechanics expert must inspect);
    - Ensure slope stabilization methods are in place if necessary;
    - Check for unexpected underground conditions (e.g., rocks, unexpected groundwater);
    - Arrange for proper soil compaction if backfilling is required;
    
3. **Drainage System Preparation**
    - Install perimeter drainage ("obodna drena≈æa");
    - Verify proper slope for water flow away from the foundation;
    - Place drainage pipe wrapped in geotextile, surrounded by gravel;
    - Plan connection of drainage system to municipal stormwater;

### Dependencies:
Cannot start foundation work until excavation is verified and drainage is in place.
