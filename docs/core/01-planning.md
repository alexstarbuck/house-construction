## Planning

Ensuring the site is ready before any physical work begins.

1. **Finalize Project Management Structure**
    - Assign roles and responsibilities (you, overseeing engineer, geo-mechanics expert, structural engineer);
    - Create project tracking spreadsheet (Excel or Gantt chart);
    - Define key milestones and dependencies;
      
2. **Secure Permits & Documentation**
    - Obtain the graÄ‘evinska dozvola (construction permit);
    - Confirm eligibility for any financial or tax reductions related to demolition/construction;
    - Ensure required documentation is in place for inspections (site plans, geotechnical report, structural plans);
      
3. **Conduct Final Site Analysis**
    - Review the geotechnical report with the geomechanics expert;
    - Assess any modifications required before excavation (verify boreholes reflect actual soil conditions);
    - Ensure final construction drawings integrate the terrain slope properly;
      
4. **Plan Site Preparation & Logistics**
    - Determine access routes for machinery and material deliveries;
    - Arrange for site fencing and security;
    - Confirm disposal process for excavation and demolition waste;
